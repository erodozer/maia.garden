It looks like that garden of yours is going to be full of beautiful flowers soon, but what do you plan to do after they bloom?

Not to worry, The Flower Shop in the Forest is now open for business!

I'll gladly pay you for any flowers you pick from your garden.  I also have seeds for you to buy!

So please stop by, I'll be waiting for you~"
