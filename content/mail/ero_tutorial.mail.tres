There's plenty to do here in your garden.  I see you've already learned that you can check your mail!  Each day you might get new messages, so check it often~

You'll also find that you can grow flowers and fish right here.  Be sure to do plenty of each so your garden and friendships flourish.

Did I say friendships?  That's right!  You have plenty of friends in the forest, but they might not be ready to see you just yet.  

In the meantime, go ahead and take care of things in the garden for a bit and tire yourself out.  When you're done, you can rest up in your house.  Oh, but maybe before that, if you still have some energy you should stream for a bit, we're all excited to see you~

Take care and have fun!"
