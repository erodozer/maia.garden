There's plenty to do here in your garden.  I see you've already learned that you can check your mail!  Each day you might get new messages, so check it often~

You'll also find that you can fish and grow flowers right here.  Be sure to do plenty of each so your garden flourishes.

You have plenty of friends in the forest, too.  Be sure to step out and say hi once in awhile, however they might not be ready to see you just yet.  

In the meantime, go ahead and take care of things in the garden for a bit and tire yourself out.  When you're done, you can rest up in your house.  Oh, but maybe before that, if you still have some energy you should stream for a bit, we're all excited to see you~

Take care and have fun!"
